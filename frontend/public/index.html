=======	EXPLANATION OF THE HOME PAGE ============

This is the main HTML file for the Logos Platform web application.
From here, the user is made able to access the application features and
navigate the website. The core idea is to provide a cyber-classic interface
that represents a sort of Delphic Temple's entrance, where users can
access their personal knowledge management system.
